# EnsembleMeAgingClock

This is computational epigenetics research that I have conducted alongside Dr. Hayan Lee and Akshay Anand. This a code dump of all the accumulating research we have been doing. File [app.py](https://github.com/YashAgarwal06/Machine-Learning-Cancer-Aging-Research/blob/main/app.py) implements our web service that utilizes our aging clock, EnsembleLR, for researchers to test their DNA methylation data. We have trained machine learning models (aging clocks) and optimized current aging clocks to improve biological age predictions across different organs in the body based on DNA methylation data. We have also conducted extensive statistical analysis to determine the best features (CpG Sites -- regions of DNA) to include in our models. Additionally, we have created many plots (heatmaps, scatter plots, boxplots, etc.) to analyze and validate our models and tested our clocks on various tissue/organ DNA methylation data (kidney, prostate, blood etc.), disease data (Parkinson's, Alzheimers, autism), and more.
